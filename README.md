# Welcome to Kudu

Kudu is a micro MVC framework centered around AMD modules and Ractive templates.

kudu provides a router for mapping URLs to controllers. Controllers are essentially AMD modules with a well defined life-cycle consisting
of an "initialization" phase, "rendering" phase and finally a "remove" phase. AMD modules can partake in these phases by implementing the
appropriate method such as "onInit", "onRender", "onRemove" etc.

Each controller has an associated View and Model. The View is a Ractive instance that binds to the Model. The Model is a plain javascript
object generally fetched as data from the server.

Quick example
-------------

_setup.js_
```javascript
// Import some controllers
var homeCtrl = require("homeCtrl");
var personCtrl = require("personCtrl");

    // Specify the routes
    var routes = {
        home: {path: 'home', ctrl: homeCtrl}
        person: {path: 'person', ctrl: personCtrl}
    };

// Initialize kudu with the given routes and a target id (#someId) where the views will
// be rendered to
    kudu.init({
        target: "#container",
        routes: routes
});
```

_homeCtrl.js_
```javascript
define(function (require) {
	var template = require("rvc!./home"); // Import the home template

	function home() {

		var that = {};

    // Implement the required onInit method that returns a Ractive ViewModel
		that.onInit = function (options) {

			 var view = createView();
			 return view;

		};

		function createView() {
		  var view = new template({
			  data: {
				  hello: "Hello World!"
				}
			});
			return view;
		}

		return that;
	}
	return home;
});
```

_home.html
```html
<div class="content">
    <div class="row">

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h1>Home page</h1>
        </div>

    </div>
</div>
```

Setup
-----

Create a web project with the following structure:

```
web
    src
        index.jsp
        css
        js
            app
            lib
                require.js
                ractive.js
                kudu
                    kudu files
            config.js
```

Kudu
----

The kudu module is a facade for the framework and most interaction with the framework is handled by the kudu module.

There is one kudu instance per application.

A new kudu instance is initialized by passing in a "target", an element ID where views will be rendered, and a "routes" object 
which specifies which URLs map to which Controllers.

Here is an example setup.js file showing how to setup and create a kudu instance:

```javascript
var kudu = require("kudu");

// Import some controllers
var homeCtrl = require("homeCtrl");
var personCtrl = require("personCtrl");
var notFoundCtrl = require("notFoundCtrl");

    // Specify the routes
    var routes = {
        home: {path: 'home', ctrl: homeCtrl}
        person: {path: 'person', ctrl: personCtrl}
        notFound: {path: '*', ctrl: notFound}
    };

// Initialize kudu with the given routes and a target id (#someId) where the views will
// be rendered to
    kudu.init({
        target: "#container",
        routes: routes
});
```

Kudu options
------------

Kudu.init() accepts the following options:

```javascript
options = {
        target: // a CSS id selector specifying the DOM node where Views will be 
                // rendered to, eg. "#container",

        routes: // an object mapping URLs to Controller modules,
        defaultRoute: // the default route to load if no path is specified eg.
                      // http://host/ instead of http://host/#home
        unknownRouteResolver: // a function that is called if none of the registered 
            // routes matches the URL

        intro: // a function for performing animations when showing the View
        outro: // a function for performing animations when removing the View
        fx: // Specify weather effects and animations should be enabled or not, default 
            // is false

        viewFactory: // Provides a hook for creating views other than Ractive 
                     // instances. See ViewFactory section below

        debug: // specify debug mode, true or false. Default is true
		};
```

unknownRouteResolver
--------------------
An optional function passed a kudu instance that is called if none of the registered routes matches the URL. This allows users to inject
custom logic to handle this situation.

The function must return a promise which resolves to a route. If the promise is rejected the "notFound" route will be used.

ViewFactory
-----------

A ViewFactory provides global hooks for creating, rendering and unrendering views from the DOM.

A custom ViewFactory must provide three functions:

```javascript
var CustomFactory = {

    createView: function(options) {
        return promise;
    }

    renderView: function(options) {
        return promise;
    }

    unrenderView: function(options) {
        return promise;
    }
}
```

The above function accepts options consisting of the following:

```javascript
	var options = {
    args: // an object that was passed to a new view from the current view
    ctrl: // the controller to create
    mvc: // the current view/controller instance
    route: // the route object to create a new view for
    routeParams: // the URL parameters
    target: // the CSS selector where the view must be rendered to
    viewOrPromise: // an object that was returned from the controller onInit() function,
                   // either a view or a promise that resolves to a view
};
```

_createView_ must return a promise that resolves to the new view instance. This view instance will be passed to the _renderView_ function

_renderView_ must return a promise that resolves once the view has been rendered to the DOM.

_unrenderView_ must return a promise that resolves once the view has been removed from the DOM.

intro / outro
-------------
These functions provides global hooks for performing animation when showing and hiding views. These functions will be invoked whenever a
view is rendered and unrendered. Note: you can also provide fune grained animations on a per view basis by providing enter/leave functions
in the _route_ object.

_intro_ is called after the view is rendered to the DOM. Here you can provide animations on the view eg. fade the view in

_outro_ is called before the view is removed from the DOM. Here you can provide animations on the view eg. fade the view out

The functions have the following format:
```javascript
var intro = function (options, done) {
}
```

options contain the following value:
```javascript
var options: {
    target: // the CSS selector where the view was rendered to,
};
```

The _done_ argument is a function to be called once the animation is finished to let kudu know the view is complete.

Router
------
Kudu includes a router that maps url paths to controllers.

The application routes are specified as an object with key/value pairs where each key is the name of the route and the value is the route
itself, which consists of a url _path_ and _controller_.

For example:

```javascript
var routes = {
			home: {path: '/home', ctrl: customer},
			customer: {path: '/customer', ctrl: customer},
			notFound: {path: '*', ctrl: notFound} // if none of the routes match the url,
                // the route defined as, '*', will match and it's controller
                // instantiated.
		};

// Pass the routes to kudu
kudu.init({
    target: "#container",
    routes: routes;
});
```

Route mappings
--------------

The following route mappings are supported:

* **Segment parameters** are specified as a colon with a name eg: /person/**:id**
The following url will match this route: _/person/1_

* Query parameters are specified as ampersand separated values after the questionmark eg: _/person?**id**&**name**_. The following url will match
this route: _/person?**id**=1&**name**=bob_

* Wildcards are specified as an asterisk eg: _/view/**&ast;**/person_. The following url will match this route: _/view/**anything**/person_

Routes
------

Routes consist of the following options:

```javascript
{
    path:     // this is the url path to match
    ctrl:     // if the path matches a url, this controller will be instantiated,
              // alternatively specify the 'moduleId' option for lazy loading of the
    moduleId: // controller if the path matches a url, the controller with this ID
              // will be instantiated, alternatively specify the 'ctrl' option for
    enter:    // eager loading of the controller a function for manually adding the 
              // view to the DOM and to perform custom intro animations. By default
    leave:    // kudu insert views into the default target a function for manually
              // removing the view from the DOM and to perform custom outro
              // animations. By default kudu remove views from the default target
}
```

New routes can also be added to router through router.__addRoute()__.

```javascript
var router = require("kudu/router/router");

router.addRoute(
    path: "/path", {
     ctrl: HomeCtrl
});
```

The route Enter function
------------------------
When navigating between views, Kudu will remove the current view from the DOM and then add the new view to the DOM. If kudu is created with
the _fx_ option set to _true_, Kudu will animate the transition between views, by fading out the current view, remove it from the DOM, add
the new view to the DOM, and finally fading in the new view.

You can customize this behaviour through a custom ViewFactory implementation and _intro_, _outro_ functions that is passed to the new Kudu
instance.

For finer grained control over the creation of views, you can provide an _enter_ function on a per route basis. When providing an _enter_
function, Kudu will delegate the rendering and animation of the view to that function.

The _enter_ function can return a Promise instance in order to perform animations on the view. Kudu will wait until the promise resolves
before continuing with other work.

Example enter function:

```javascript

var route: {
    path: "/home",
    ctrl: HomeController,
    enter: function(options) {
        var d = $.deferred();

        options.view.render(options.target); // Append view to DOM

        $(options.target).slidDown(function() { // Use jQuery to slide the view down
            d.resolve(); // Resolve the promise to notify Kudu that the view is complete
        });

        return d.promise();
    }
}
```

Enter accepts the following options: 

```javascript
var options = {
    ctrl:       // the new controller instance
    prevCtrl:   // the previous controller instance
    view:       // the new view instance
    prevView:   // the previous view instance
    route:      // the new route instance
    prevRoute:  // the previous route instance
    target:     // the default DOM target as passed to the Kudu instance
};
```

The route Leave function
------------------------
Similar to the _enter_ function _ _leave_ provides finer grained control to remove the view from the DOM and animate it.

When providing a _leave_ function, Kudu will delegate the unrendering and animation of the view to that function.

The _leave_ function can return a Promise instance in order to perform animations on the view. Kudu will wait until the promise resolves
before continuing with other work.

Example leave function:

```javascript

var route: {
    path: "/home",
    ctrl: HomeController,
    leave: function(options) {
        var d = $.deferred();

        $(options.target).slidUp(function() { // Use jQuery to slide the view up
            options.view.unrender(options.target); // Remove view from the DOM
            d.resolve(); // Resolve the promise to notify Kudu that the view is complete
        });

        return d.promise();
    }
}
```

Leave accepts the following options: 

```javascript
var options = {
    ctrl:       // the new controller instance
    prevCtrl:   // the previous controller instance
    view:       // the new view instance
    prevView:   // the previous view instance
    route:      // the new route instance
    prevRoute:  // the previous route instance
    target:     // the default DOM target as passed to the Kudu instance
};
```

Controllers
-----------
Controllers are AMD modules that must return an object which implement an _onInit_ function. _onInit_ must return a Ractive View instance
or a Promise which resolves to a Ractive View. (If you want to implement views in an alternative technology to Ractive, eg. normal HTML,
you can specify a custom _ViewFactory_ to handle different types of views).

Example controller:

```javascript
    define(function (require) {

        var template = require("rvc!./home");
	
        function homeCtrl() {
		
            var that = {}; // The object we will return from our module

            that.onInit = function(options) {
                var data = {hello: "Hello World"};
                var view = new template( { data: data } );
                return view;
            }
		
            return that;
        }

        return homeCtrl;
    });
```

In the home controller above, we return an object that contains an _onInit_ method. _onInit_ receives an _options_ object and must return the view.

In Kudu, views are Ractive instances, consisting of an HTML template and data. Ractive binds the HTML template and data to form the view.

onInit must return a Ractive instance (the view) or a promise which resolves to a Ractive instance.

The Ractive HTML template is imported as an AMD module through the "rvc" plugin. This plugin transforms an HTML Ractive template by compiling
it to a Ractive function, ready to be instantiated.

onInit
------

Controllers in kudu must implement an onInit method. onInit must return a Ractive view instance or function (kudu will instantiate it if needed)
or a promise which resolves to a Ractive view instance or function.

onInit options
--------------

The following options are passed to the onInit method:

```javascript
options = {
  ajaxTracker: // provides a means of registering ajax calls in the controller. Ajax
               // calls tracked this way will automatically abort when the view is
               // removed. ajaxTracker also provides a way to listen to ajax lifecycle
               //  events such as ajax.start / ajax.stop etc.

routeParams:   // all URL parameters (including segment parameters and query parameters) 
               // are passed to the controller through the routeParams object.

args:          // arguments passed to the controller from another controller. args can 
               // only be passed to a view when called from a controller, not when 
               // navigating via the URL hash
}
```


onRemove
--------

Controllers can optionally implement an _onRemove_ method. This method controls whether the view can be removed or not. onRemove must return
either true or false or a promise that resolves to true or false.

If _onRemove_ returns true, the view will be removed. If false, the request will be cancelled and the view will not be removed. This is useful
in situations where a view wants to stop the user from navigating away until changes in a form has been saved, for example.

onRemove options
----------------

The following options are passed to the onRemove method:

```javascript
options = {
  ajaxTracker: // provides a means of registering ajax calls in the controller. Ajax
               //  calls tracked this way will automatically abort when the view is
               //  removed. ajaxTracker also provides a way to listen to ajax lifecycle
               //  events such as ajax.start / ajax.stop etc.

routeParams:   // all URL parameters (including segment parameters and query parameters)
               // are passed to the controller through the routeParams object.

args:          // arguments passed to the controller from another controller. args can
               // only be passed to a view when called from a controller, not when 
               // navigating via the URL hash

view:          // a reference to the view that is going to be removed
}
```

Gobal events
------------

You can subscribe to global events fired by kudu as follows:

```javascript
var kudu = require("kudu/kudu");
$(kudu).on('viewInit', function (e, options) {
    // called whenever a view has been initialized
});
```
	
The following global events exist:
```
viewBeforeInit     : called before the controller.onInit method is called
viewInit           : called after the controller.onInit method is called
viewRender         : called after the controller's Ractive view has been added to the
                     DOM
viewComplete       : called after the controller's Ractive view has been rendered and
                     completed 
                     any transitions
viewBeforeUnrender : called before view is removed from the dom. this event only 
                     occurs 
                     if the Controller.onRemove method returns true
viewUnrender       : called after the controller's Ractive view has been removed
                     from the DOM
viewFail           : called when a view failed to create
```

Global event options
--------------------
The following options are passed to the events:

```javascript
options = {
    prevCtrl     : // previous controller which is being removed
    newCtrl     : // new controller being added
    isMainCtrl  : // (experimental) true if the new controller replaces the main view eg.
                  // the target 
                  // specified in kudu initialization is replaced. If false
                  // it means the new controller is a sub view on another controller
    ctrlOptions : // all the options used for the new controller
		eventName   : // name of the event which fired
		error       : // optionally specifies the error (an array of error messages)
                  // which led to the event being triggered
}
```

Controller events
-----------------

The following events exist on a controller:
```
onInit     : the initialization event which must be implemented by each controller
onRender   : called after the view has been added to the DOM
onComplete : called after the view has been added to the DOM AND once all transitions
             has completed.
onRemove   : called before removing the controller
onUnrender : called after the view has been removed from the DOM
```

Controller events example:
--------------------------

```javascript
define(function (require) {

        var template = require("rvc!./home");
	
        function homeCtrl() {
		
            var that = {};

            that.onInit = function(options) {
            
                var view = new template();
                return view;
            }

            that.onRender = function(options) {
                // View has been added to the DOM
            }

            that.onComplete = function(options) {
                // view has been added to the DOM and transitions completed
            }
		
            return that;
        }
        return homeCtrl;
    });
```
